I was a co-author for this paper. Thank you to Dr. Gong and the other collaborators for teaching me so much during the manuscript-writing process!

##### Abstract

The plasma membrane is crucial to the survival of animal cells, and damage to it can be lethal, often resulting in necrosis. However, cells possess multiple mechanisms for repairing the membrane, which allows them to maintain their integrity to some extent, and sometimes even survive. Interestingly, cells that survive a near-necrosis experience can recognize sub-lethal membrane damage and use it as a signal to secrete chemokines and cytokines, which activate the immune response. This review will present evidence of necrotic cell survival in both in vitro and in vivo systems, including in C. elegans, mouse models, and humans. We will also summarize the various membrane repair mechanisms cells use to maintain membrane integrity. Finally, we will propose a mathematical model to illustrate how near-death experiences can transform dying cells into innate immune modulators for their microenvironment. By utilizing their membrane repair activity, the biological effects of cell death can extend beyond the mere elimination of the cells.
