##### Abstract

Skin cancers are the most common cancers (Cassidy et al., 2022). If detected and treated
early, skin cancer is unlikely to result in fatality (American Academy of Dermatology
Association, 2022). Unfortunately, there is a global shortage of dermatologists to detect early
signs of skin cancer, especially in remote areas and developing countries (Li et al., 2022). To fill
this need, digital teledermatology solutions based on machine learning (ML) algorithms trained
on massive public datasets (Li et al., 2022) have become increasingly popular. In recent years,
teledermatology models have shown comparable or better diagnostic performance than
professional dermatologists (Wen et al., 2022). These models are especially prevalent in the
diagnosis stage, using algorithms that classify images of skin lesions as malignant or benign.
Some dermatologists expressed concerns about teledermatology, citing algorithmic bias
stemming from the historical biases and underrepresentation of certain skin tones in popular
dermatology datasets (Butt et al., 2021, Fathy & Lipoff, 2022). Approaches to mitigate this bias
include initiatives for more representative datasets (Ganapathi et al., 2022) and directly
modifying algorithms (Rezk et al., 2022a). Others advocate for unlocked algorithms that will be
retrained as more representative datasets are released (Mittermaier et al., 2023).
