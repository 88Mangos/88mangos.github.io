##### Jupyter Notebook

If you want to run the Hough Transform Jupyter Notebook, download [HoughTransform.ipynb](https://github.com/88Mangos/88mangos.github.io/blob/main/content/projects/2023-06_Hough_Transform/HoughTransform.ipynb) and run everything inside the notebook. There are no system-specific paths required, just an updated version of Matplotlib and NumPy.
