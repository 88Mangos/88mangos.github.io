##### Jupyter Notebook

If you want to run the Data Science in Soccer analysis, download [DS_Soccer.ipynb](https://github.com/88Mangos/88mangos.github.io/blob/main/content/projects/2023-05_Scoring_First_Soccer/DS_Soccer.ipynb) and [epl-2022-UTC.xlsx](https://github.com/88Mangos/88mangos.github.io/blob/main/content/projects/2023-05_Scoring_First_Soccer/epl-2022-UTC.xlsx). Make sure to adjust the filepath in the third cell, second line of DS_Soccer.ipynb to ensure the code properly reads in the data from epl-2022-UTC.xlsx.
