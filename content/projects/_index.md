## Some Projects You Won't See
---
For some reason (e.g., they are solutions to my coursework), I cannot share code for the following projects:

### Computer Systems, 18-213 @ CMU
- cache simulator and cache optimization of matrix transpose
- custom malloc implementation
- writing a terminal shell
- implemented in C

### Turing Machine Simulator, 15-251 @ CMU
- and some Karp reductions (computational complexity)
- implemented in Python

### Sequence Analysis Toolkit, 02-180 & 02-181 @ CMU
- hidden markov models
- sequence alignment algorithms
- Viterbi algorithm
- Burrows-Wheeler transform
- suffix tries
- implemented in Python

### c0 Virtual Machine, 15-122 @ CMU
- as well as a simple text editor and Huffman encoding algorithm
- implemented in C

### Analyzing Page Ranking Algorithms, Linear Algebra (21-241) @ CMU
- PageRank vs HITS
- implemented in Julia

### Identifying Asymmetric Cell Division, Hybrid Internship at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center
-  semantic segmentation of fluorescence microsopy images in order to identify asymemtrically dividing T cells
- achieved over 90% accuracy compared to human-labeled test data, outperforming similar commercial software from Sartorius released shortly after my internship
- implemented in MATLAB and ImageJ Java Scripts
